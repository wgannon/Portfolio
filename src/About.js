      <p>Hello World! I'm a Map Nerd and after my masters at UW
      Madison. I stummbled into GIS in college and while working further stumbled into programming and 
      My current goal to become hired as a developer. I enjoy the planning, problem solving, and creative aspects
      that Developing offers. It is both challenging and fulfilling which is why I have been interested in it and pursued
      a degree that offered a structured and friendly path into it via GIS web development.</p>
